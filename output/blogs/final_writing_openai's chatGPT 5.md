OpenAI is also making changes to promote a healthier relationship between users and **ChatGPT**, particularly for sensitive topics. For instance, it will no longer give definitive answers to personal questions like "Should I break up with my boyfriend?" Instead, it will "help you think it through - asking questions, weighing pros and cons." This shift indicates a move towards AI as a thoughtful assistant rather than an authoritative oracle, aiming for more responsible and supportive interactions that empower users to make their own informed decisions.

Looking ahead, Sam Altman's vision extends to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which he believes will be "the most important technology humanity has ever developed." He has openly expressed admiration for the AI depicted in the 2013 film *Her*, seeing it as "the best single vision of what we're building," hinting at a future where AI companions are deeply integrated into human lives, albeit with the acknowledged societal challenges.

## Expert Perspectives: Navigating the New AI Frontier

The launch of **ChatGPT 5** has elicited a range of expert opinions, from fervent optimism to cautious skepticism. Sam Altman's own statements reflect a dual perspective: immense excitement for the "tremendous upsides" of advanced AI, coupled with a pragmatic acknowledgment that "this is not all going to be good, there will still be problems." He emphasizes the need for society to adapt and establish new guardrails as AI capabilities grow.

However, some industry observers are less sanguine. An infrastructure provider familiar with OpenAI's architecture described **ChatGPT 5** as "potentially more expensive to run" and "significantly more convoluted, plagued by latency issues, and is more compute-intensive." There's a sentiment that the product feels "rushed to market by a desperate company that had to get something out the door," suggesting that OpenAI may be bolting on complex tools rather than building a fundamentally robust product.
