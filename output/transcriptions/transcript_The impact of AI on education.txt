Hello friends and very warm welcome to everyone tuning in today especially from our vibrant Indian audience. We are living in an era of unprecedented technological advancement and one of the most transformative force shaping our world is undoubtedly artificial intelligence or AI. Today we are asking a crucial question. Is AI the future of our education? Think back to uh to our own school days. The
classroom setup, the way information was delivered, the method of assessment, many of these uh remained relatively consistent for decades. But the world around us is evolving at a lightning speed, demanding new skills, new ways of thinking. Uh can traditional education model keep the pace? AI is no longer a futuristic fantasy. It is becoming deeply embedded in our daily lives. From smartphones in
our pocket to algorithm that curate our news feed. It's only natural to wonder how this powerful technology will reshape the landscape of learning. Over the next few minutes, we will dwell into the exciting possibilities, potential challenges, and the very real way AI is already starting to influence the education. One of the most compelling uh promises of AI in education is the potential for
truly personalized learning. Imagine a learning experience that adapt to your individual strength, weaknesses, learning style, and pace. This isn't the pipe dream. AIdriven platforms are already making significant strides in this direction. Think about it. Some of us are visual learners absorbing information best through diagrams and videos. Others are auditory learners thriving on discussions and
lectures. Still others learn best through hands-on activities. Traditional classrooms often struggle to cater to this diverse range of learning preferences. AI however can analyze a students interaction with learning material, identify pattern in their understanding and adjust the content and delivery accordingly. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, the AI can offer additional
explanations, alternative examples, or even recommend a different learning resource. If a student is grasping concept quickly, then AI can provide more challenging material to keep them engaged, push their boundaries. This level of uh individual uh attention can lead to more effective learning outcomes, increase engagement and a greater sense of ownership over one's education. Students can learn
at their own speed, focusing on areas where they need uh the most support and accelerating through topics they grasp quickly. This can uh be a particularly beneficial for students with learning differences or those who may feel left behind in a traditional class classroom settings. Imagine having a dedicated tutor available around the clock ready to answer your questions, provide feedback and
guide you through challenging material. This is the potential of intelligent tutoring system or IT powered by AI. These systems go beyond simply providing pre-programmed answers. They can understand the nuance of a student's question, identify the underlying misconception and offer tailored explanation. Think of them as a highly knowledgeable digital mentors. It can provide immediate feedback
which is crucial for effective learning. Instead of waiting days or weeks for graded assignments, student can learn um uh to go with their pace, receive instant insight into their understanding and correct mistakes in real time. This can foster a more iterative and active learning process. Furthermore, its can often break down complex topics into smaller, more manageable chunks, making them easier
to understand. They can also track a students progress over time, identifying areas of strength and weaknesses, and adjusting their learning path accordingly. This constant uh monitoring and adaptation can lead to significant improvement in student performance and deeper understanding of the subject matter. The focus on AI in education often centers on the student experience but its potential to
support educator is equally significant. Teachers dedicate countless hours to task that could potentially be automated, freeing them to focus on what they do best, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and meaningful connections with their students. One key area is automated grading. AI power tool can analyze essays, multiplechoice test and even code submission with remarkable accuracy and the
speed. This can significantly reduce the administrative burden of the teachers allowing them to dedicate more time to lessons planning, providing pro uh personalized feedback and addressing individual student needs. Beyond grading, AI can also assist with content generation. Imagine teachers u you know being able to quickly generate uh practice questions, quizzes or even entire lessons. Uh uh all
these plans tailored to specific needs of their students. AI can analyze uh existing resources, identify gaps and create new materials saving educator valuable time and efforts. This doesn't mean replacing teachers. Rather, it's about empowering them with powerful tools to enhance their effectiveness and create more dynamic and engaging learning environment. By automating routine task, AI can help
teachers focus on human aspects of education, mentorship, guidance, and inspiring a love of learning. Now, let's bring this discussion closer to home. Here in India and specifically in major cities, India has a vast uh and diverse education system with its own unique set of opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to address some of uh these key areas. Consider the challenge of providing
quality education to a large and uh geographically dispersed population. AI powered online learning platform and virtual tutor can bridge geographical barriers and make education uh resources uh teachers more accessible to students in remote areas. Furthermore, AI can help personalize learning for students in crowded classrooms where individual attention can be limited. Adaptive learning platforms
can cater to diverse learning needs with single classroom ensuring that no student is left behind. However, the implementation of AI in Indian education also presents certain challenges. Ensuring equitable access to technology and digital literacy across all socioeconomic strata is crucial. We also need to develop AI solutions that are relevant to Indian curriculum and cultural context. Moreover,
addressing concerns about data privacy, algorithm bias and the potential displacement of educator requires very careful consideration and proactive planning. It is essential to approach the integration of AI in education with a thoughtful and ethical framework ensuring that it serves the best interest of all learners and educators. The impact of AI on education extend far beyond the traditional
classroom setting. In today's rapidly evolving job market, lifelong learning and continuous skill development are becoming increasingly important. AI can play a crucial role in supporting this ongoing learning journey. AI powered platform can analyze uh an individual skills and career goals, recommending relevant courses, training programs and learning resources. They can also track progress,
identify a skill gaps and provide personalized learning pathways for professional development. Think about the everinccreasing need for digital literacy and AI fluency across various industries. AI powered learning tools can help individuals acquire these essential skills making them more competitive in the job market and enabling them to adapt to uh changing demand of the workforce. Furthermore,
AI can facilitate personalized learning in corporate training environment, helping employees acquire new skills and knowledge more effectively and efficiently. This can lead to more skilled and adaptable workforce driving innovation and economic growth. While the potential benefit of AI in education are immense, it is important to acknowledge and address the legitimate concerns surrounding its
implementation. Ethical consideration, data privacy, the role of human interaction and crucial aspect of uh this discussion need to be analyzed first. One major concerns revolve around data privacy and security. AI powered learning platform collect vast amount of data of student and essentially uh you know it ensures that this data is handled responsibly and ethically. Robust data protection
measures and transparent data usage policies are crucial to build trust and ensure the privacy of learner. Another concern is the potential for algorithmic bias. If the AI models are trained on bias data, uh they could perpetuate or or even amplify existing inequalities in education. It is crucial to develop AI systems that are fair, equitable, and inclusive for all learners regardless of their
background. Finally, it is important to remember that education is fundamentally a human endeavor. While AI can be a powerful tool, it should not replace the crucial role of teachers as mentors, guide and facilitator of learning. The human connections, empathy and the ability to inspire critical thinking and creativity are irreplaceable aspect of the educational experience. The future of education
like uh lies in the synerggetic partnership between AI and human educator leveraging the strength of both. AI in education uh is not just futuristic concept. It is already being implemented in various forms around the world and here in India. Let's uh take a look at some current examples. We are seeing emergence of AI powered learning platform that offer personalized learning pathways and adaptive
content. Intelligent tutoring systems are being used in subjects like mathematics, language learning to provide students with individualized support. AI tools are also being used for administrative task such as automated grading of certain types of assessments and scheduling. Some educational institutions are even experimenting with AI powered chat bots to answer student queries and provide
support. While these are still early stages, they provide a glimpse into transformative potential of AI in education. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and impactful applications emerge in years to come. So what does this uh all means for student, parent and educator? How can we prepare for a future where AI plays a major prominent role in
education? So for student it means embracing a more active and personalized learning journey. It's about developing digital literacy uh new skills uh and also uh being comfortable with using AI powered tools and taking ownership of their learning. For parent it involves understanding the potential benefit and challenges of AI in education and engaging in informed conversation with educators and
their children about technologies. It's also about fostering a growth mindset and encouraging lifelong learning for educator is about embracing professional development opportunities to understand and leverage AI tools effectively. It's about exploring new you know new approach that integrates uh AI to enhance teaching and learning. It's also about playing a crucial role in shaping the ethical and
responsible implementation of AI in education. Ultimately, preparing for the future of education requires a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, students, parents, educators, policy makers, and technology developers working together to harness the power of AI for the benefit of all learners. As we approach uh to the end of our discussion, as we wrap up, let us revisit this central question
that is is AI the future of education. So based on what we've explored today, it's clear that AI has a potential to be significant force in shaping the future of learning. From personalized learning experience and intelligent tutoring systems to automated administrative task and support for lifelong learning, AI offers a wealth of opportunities to enhance education for students, educator and
society as a whole. However, it is important to emphasize that AI is not a silver bullet. Its successful integration into education requires careful planning, ethical consideration, addressing equity concerns and uh a recognition of the crucial role of human interaction. The future of education is likely not one where AI completely replace human educator but rather one where AI act as a powerful
partner augmenting their capabilities and creating more effective and engaging learning experiences. It's a future where technology empowers both learners and educators to reach their full potential. We are just scratching the surface of this vast and rapidly evolving field. I encourage you to contribute and continue exploring the possibility of AI in education. Seek out information about AI

So good morning miss. Now we're going to talk about the impact of AI on education from apply digital skills. So now um talk about the group members. My name is Joanna. My name is Sua and I'm James. >> So now I'm going to introduce the table of content of what we're going to explain. First we have introduction and the three body graph and then the conclusion. Now I'm going to pass it to Swa. >> So
today I will introduce the topic AI and education. AI and education means using smart digital tools that can analyze, adapt and support learning for both teachers and students with the with the risk of the online technology based on learning. AI is now a important part of modern classrooms. It can make learning more personalized, efficient and accessible. However, it also has the challenges such
as privacy risks, lacks face-to-face interaction and overall reliance and on technology. So, in this presentation, we will focus three key areas. It's a datadriven insights, uh, grading and feedback and AI accessibilities. So, I will pass to Jane. So I'll be talking about the first body paragraph which is AI and accessibility. So the first one we have the advantages. As for the first one we have
inclusive learning tools where AI tools help students with disabilities, physical, cognitive and language related, visually impaired such as screen readers and audio descriptions, hearing difficulties such as realtime captioning or transcription. And there's also dyslexia or ADHD where reading aids and structured support, non-native speakers use such use translation tools. So the next one will be
AI supported remote and adaptive learning where adaptive learning software reacts in real time to student progress. Virtual classrooms stimulate real life learning with pace adjustments. AI chatbots or tutors support students any time especially in self-paced learning. The third one will be interactive and culturally relevant learning where teachers can input local examples into AI platforms and
AI also gamifies learning to make it engaging and personalized. The next one I'll be talking about the disadvantages where we have the first one will be digital inequality. AI needs stable internet, modern devices and also tech support to work. Whereas uh when it comes to language and cultural bias most AI tools are in English or dominant global languages and it's also less useful in multilingual
or local language classrooms. It also lack of inclusive design where many tools are created without input from teachers or students and may not meet real classroom needs. Next I'll be passing to SA. Sorry, I'll be passing to Joanna. >> Okay. Now I'm going to talk about the automatic grading and feedback. First we have the advantage and firstly we have efficiency and time saving. So because AI
grading system can produce with large volumes of assignment and it can be more faster when it comes to compared to manual grading and it can help the educators to free up time for other tasks like lesson planning person and personalized student interaction. Next we have consist consistency and objectivity. uh because AI algorithm applied pri criteria consistent it reduce the potential of
suggestive bias that can occur during manual grading. Next we have immediate feedback. So when students submit their work they can immediately receive the feedback. So it allows them to correct their errors quickly and potentially leading to faster learning progress. Then we have scalability because uh AI can handle large class size and multiple assignment. It's suitable for online course and
larger institutions. Last we have datadriven insights. So an AI can use to analyze the student performance to identify the patterns strength weakness to provide valuable insights. However, do despite all these positive and advantages, it still have negative. The first one we have is bias in algorithm. So despite AI really can help uh it can have bias in its evolution and leading to unfair and
discriminate outcomes. So the next one we have reduce human interaction because over reliance on AI can dismal opportunities of interaction between student teachers which is might be crucial for personal learning and addressing students individual needs. Then we have lack of notion and context because AI may uh struggle to understand creativity writing and complex arguments. So it may lead to
inaccurate or unfair assessment. Last we have potent uh last but not least we have potential for oral reliance. So because nowadays AI is so common uh student might be over reliant for solution and potentially hindering the development of criteria thinking problem solving and independent learning skills. Last we have job displayment. So although that AI can automate task, it can also uh lead to
the potential displayment of human educators. Now I'll passing it to SA. >> I'm going to present a third body paragraph which is datadriven insights got the positive and advant advantages got negative as a disadvantages. So now let's look at the positive side of datadriven insights in education. First we have a realtime student moni monitoring. This means AI can instantly track things like
participation in the class, time span and tasks, quiz results and overall engagement. This is done to wait until exam to know how student is doing. So the next point is the person personalized learning. AI can suggest specific exercises or extra support for students who are struggling based on their individual needs. This helps them improves faster. The next is enhanced teaching methods with AI
showing detailed learning patterns. Teachers can adapt lessons to fit what works best for their students. Also, we have support diverse learning level levels. In a big classroom, AI can help provide extra assistance to weaker students while allowing advanced learners to keep progressing. And also we have higher education on online learning. AI can even predict dropout risks, track academic
progress and give support for student studying remotely. Lastly, but not least, inform policy decision making with accurate data. Schools and education departments can make a better plans and strategies to improve learning outcomes. So, we have a disadvantage. Of course, there are also disadvantages. So, firstly, we have a data privacy concerns. Uh sensitive student information can be be hacked or
misused if not protected properly. After that we have a lack of transparency. Sometimes students and parents are not told how their data is stored or used which can cause tr issues and also uh we have a surveillance and psychology effects as a constant monitoring may take students feel stress pressure or like they are always being watched. So the next point is the over depends on AI. Teachers
might start drilling too much on technology instead of their own teaching experience and judgment. And the lastly is the mislabeling and the motivation issues. If AI labels the students as a low performer, it can damage their confidence and motivation to improve. That's all from me. I'm pass to J. So as for the conclusion, AI improves accessibility and personalization and it also reduces teacher
workload where finds learning gaps for better strategies. But however there are challenges with inequality, bias and privacy and the risk will be over reliance where we attempt to lose creativity, critical thinking or human touch. So the best approach will be AI supports human teaching and not replaces it. That's the conclusion and now we'll be showing the reference and that's all from us. Thank
you.

Artificial intelligence AI was supposed to transform education as we know it. But here's the shocking truth. Its impact on university education remains surprisingly minimal. Why hasn't this revolutionary technology lived up to the hype? Our recent study https eere.net index.php/epsere PHP/EPSI article view/728 delves into this question examining AI's integration into universities from both
scientific and social perspectives. And this is the part most people miss. While researchers rave about AI's potential for personalized learning, the public's perception tells a very different story, revealing a slow and uneven adoption, particularly in Europe. In theory, AI has been making inroads into education, especially in areas like personalized learning, virtual tutoring, and administrative
automation. Platforms such as Smart Sparrow, Newton, Century Tech, and Khan Academy leverage AI to tailor learning experiences to individual student needs. These systems analyze performance metrics, correct or incorrect answers, response times, and error patterns to adjust difficulty levels, content types, and pacing while recommending supplementary resources like exercises, videos, or readings?
But here's where it gets controversial. Are these tools truly transforming education, or are they just scratching the surface? Virtual tutors powered by AI are another promising application. These chat bots or assistants mimic human tutors, answering questions, proposing exercises, providing explanations, and even offering step-by-step problem-solving guidance. Examples include Kmigo, Khan Academy
plus GPT4 for math, writing, and science. Dualingo Max for language learning, Google's Socratic which provides visual explanations and Carnegie Learning's Mika an AI powered math tutor. Yet despite these advancements, their widespread adoption remains limited. But why? A major hurdle is the lack of trainings that educators and administrators in AI tools. Many teachers lack the skills to integrate
these technologies effectively, stifling their classroom adoption. Additionally, unclear policies on student data privacy and ethical AI use pose significant barriers. And this is the part most people miss. Even Europe, a leader in ethical technology regulations, lags behind in scientific research on integrating AI into educational methods. Exceptions exist, of course. The UK boasts robust
research on AI ethics in education, adaptive teaching models, and automated assessments. Germany and the Netherlands are also making strides through interdisciplinary EU projects combining education, cognitive sciences, and computer science. Meanwhile, the United States leads in scientific publications, patents, and AIdriven educational technology development. China too has seen a surge in AI
applications, particularly in adaptive learning and facial recognition in smart classrooms fueled by massive state investment in smart education. Latin America, especially Brazil, Chile, and Mexico is also making progress with growing research output in adaptive platforms and learning data analysis. There's a rising interest in using AI to bridge educational gaps and improve access in underserved
areas. But here's where it gets controversial. Is AI truly democratizing education or is it exacerbating existing inequalities? In our study, we compared research on AI in education with its social perception through social media mentions. https fierce.org tags social media. While researchers focus on AI's academic impact, social media users are largely indifferent or unaware of its role in
universities. Most online discussions center on tools like Chat GPT, which assist with practical tasks rather than transformative learning experiences. This disconnect raises a critical question. Are we underestimating AI's potential or overhyping its capabilities? So where is AI in education headed? Personalized learning and task automation are just the beginning. To unlock its true potential, we
must invest in teacher training, develop clear policies, and foster collaboration between researchers, institutions, and society. AI is opening new doors, but its adoption faces significant barriers, especially in Europe. Bridging these gaps requires both scientific innovation and societal acceptance. But here's the ultimate question. Will AI revolutionize education or will it remain a tool on the
periphery of learning? What do you think? Is AI the future of education or is it overpromised and underdelivered? Share your thoughts in the comments. Let's spark a debate.

Welcome to the deep dive, your shortcut to being wellinformed. Today we're plunging into a topic that's not just reshaping industries, but truly revolutionizing how we learn and uh how we teach. Artificial intelligence in education. Okay, let's unpack this a bit. Our mission for this deep dive really is to explore the current impact and the future impact too of AI on education. We want to move
beyond just the headlines, you know, understand the practical applications, the benefits which are pretty undeniable. and of course the significant challenges it presents. We've sifted through quite a stack of sources for you. Yeah. And what's truly fascinating here, I think, is how this technology is touching well, basically every facet of the educational experience from the actual classroom
right up to curriculum planning. We'll try to uncover how AI is making learning more personalized, more efficient, while also importantly creating new demands for skills and raising some pretty crucial questions about its responsible use. Okay, so let's kick things off with AI's core transformations. We've uh always struggled with true personalization in education, haven't we? I mean, how do you
genuinely tailor content to each students unique learning rhythm and like their comprehension style? This is precisely where AI offers such a transformative solution. It's adapting educational software to individual paces, individual perceptions. It feels like a real gamecher for truly customized learning. Absolutely. It really is. And beyond just that personalization piece, AI is empowering smart
content creation for teachers, for researchers in ways we've just never seen before. Imagine uh visualizing complex information with 2D 3D models that can stimulate real life experiences. It makes abstract concepts so much more tangible. Or think about generating bitsiz learning digital lessons. These short focused modules designed for quick digestible learning. They're low storage, accessible
anywhere, anytime. Our sources actually highlight platforms like Gurushala. App Inventive developed it and it's now educating millions. It received $2 million in funding, got something like 20 national media mentions. The scale of impact there is genuinely impressive. It really is. That shows how quickly AI powered education can actually reach millions. And it's not just about creating the content
initially, is it? AI also enables like frequent content updates which ensures educational materials stay current, stay relevant. That's a huge benefit in our fastch changing world. But AI isn't just about content and direct learning. It's also freeing up educators, automating mountains of administrative operations. We're talking tasks like, you know, checking homework, grading tests, organizing
research papers, maintaining reports, making presentations and notes, managing all those other daily admin duties. So AI is basically the administrative fairy godmother we always dreamed of. It certainly is giving educators back their most valuable resource, time. And that time saving, well, it translates into more effective teaching. Hopefully, AI also plays a pretty crucial role in adaptable
access within classrooms. Think about features like multilingual support, translating information into various languages. Makes it convenient for every native speaker to learn. Yeah, that's huge. It also assists students who might be visually or hearing impaired with tools like presentation translator providing real-time subtitles for virtual lectures. In fact, uh there was an October 2023 Forbes
advisor survey 500 US educators. It found over 60% rely on AIdriven classrooms just to simplify and streamline their daily teaching responsibilities. Wow. Over 60%. That's significant. So, we've seen this incredible potential of AI to revolutionize how we learn and teach. Yeah. But what does this all mean for your everyday learning experience? Whether you're a student, an educator, or maybe a
lifelong learner. to really understand the tangible impact. Let's look at how leading innovators are actually putting these AI capabilities into action, bringing these transformations to life in the real world. Right? If we connect this to the bigger picture, we see how these capabilities are being implemented by some really big brands. Take Google for instance. Their Google classroom uses AI
algorithms for things like automated grading, sure, but also individualized recommendations for learning materials and even analyzing student data patterns. Okay. Then you've got Google Translate obviously breaking down language barriers and Google Scholar simplifying academic research for millions. And Duolingo certainly stands out as a prime example there. What specifically about its AI system
allows it to, you know, so effectively monitor student progress and keep learners genuinely engaged because keeping people engaged is often the hardest part. Right. Exactly. Dualingo's AI, it's continuously monitoring student progress. It identifies areas where you might be struggling, areas for development, and then it dynamically modifies the course content just for you. And it's not just
lessons. It offers personalized vocabulary drills, speech recognition practice, and it wraps it all up in this gamified approach that makes language learning genuinely sticky, as they say. Sticky. Yeah. Then there's Corsera. leverage AI for personalized course recommendations, adaptive learning paths, automated assessments, dynamically adjusting content based on how a learner is progressing and
what they prefer. And Quizlet, their AI powered learn mode is, I think, a real gamecher for studying. It creates these personalized study plans by figuring out what concepts you already know well and crucially the areas where you need to focus more. Makes studying much more efficient, much more effective. Definitely. And we can't forget squirrel AI. It's recognized as the world's first
international edtech company delivering large-scale AI powered adaptive learning. It's continuously assessing student knowledge, customizing learning paths, adjusting content and exercises to match each students level and pace. What's truly remarkable across all these platforms, really from a global giant like Google to a more niche leader like Squirrel AI, is how AI isn't just a tool for
automation anymore. It's fundamentally redesigning the very architecture of learning, making it infinitely adaptable, accessible, pushing us beyond that old one-sizefits-all model for good. And the results we're seeing from this integration are really compelling. One source mentioned, "An intelligent tutoring system improved fifth grade math students grades by 30%." Wow. And reduced their anxiety
by 20%. And get this, IBM Watson's AI chatbot, Joel Watson, used at Georgia Tech. It achieved an astounding 97% success rate, answering 10,000 student inquiries per semester. 97%. It's like having this superefficient teaching assistant available 24/7. Yeah. So, okay, we've seen how AI is revolutionizing how we learn and teach right now, but let's zoom out a bit. Look at the bigger picture. If AI
is changing education this profoundly, what does it mean for the workforce of tomorrow? And are we truly preparing for that future? It leads to a really provocative question, I think. Are business schools still relevant if they're not preparing graduates for an AIdriven economy? It really is a critical question and our sources highlight this growing mismatch between the skills employers want and
what's actually in the current curriculum. The McKenzie Global Institute uh they estimate at least 70% of companies will adopt some aspect of AI tech by 2030 and maybe even more staggering. 60% of current occupations have the possibility of being automated in the next 10 years. Like 60%. Yeah. This isn't just a trend. It's a seismic shift we're talking about. And the challenge for business
schools, well, it's immense. Changing curriculum is often described as a herculean task, isn't it? Right. There's this strong emphasis now on moving away from the old silo approach teaching marketing here finance there in isolation right towards a more integrated multid-disciplinary focus on actual business processes yeah as uh Russell Akoff a pioneer in management science so aptly put it there is
no such thing as a marketing problem or a financial problem or production problem these are points of view not kinds of problems exactly and this shift is creating entirely new job categories jobs that are uniquely human and require skills for which there really are no precedents yet. Our sources identify three main types of these new AIdriven jobs. First, you have trainers. These are humans who
teach AI systems how to perform. Think empathy trainers for customer service chat bots like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa teaching them to detect human complexities, subtleties in communication. Interesting. Second are explainers. These are individuals who bridge the gap between the complex AI technologies and business leaders. They provide clarity on the uh blackbox nature of AI systems. You
know those algorithms where you can't easily see how they reached a conclusion. That's the transparency issue. Precisely. They explain why an AI system presented a particular solution that's becoming increasingly vital as AI gets more complex. And finally, sustainers. These roles ensure AI systems operate as designed and importantly address unintended consequences. This includes roles like the
ethics compliance manager, a watchdog role. Exactly. A watchdog uncovering bias or discrimination in AI algorithms, working with analysts to implement fixes. These emerging roles, they really underscore a profound shift. The future of work isn't just AI replacing humans. It's humans and AI co-creating value with humans excelling in these uniquely interpersonal, ethical, and interpretive roles that
AI frankly cannot replicate. So beyond just the technical AI knowledge, it's clear that employers are increasingly valuing these intellectual skills and people skills. Absolutely. These crucial skills include things like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, change management, insight, creativity, sound judgment, and critically effective communication. The ability to communicate data
clearly, accurately to decision makers, that's critically important. It's not enough just to do the analysis. You have to explain it, make the case. Yeah. And this brings us to a phenomenon known as data hubris. We all know garbage in, garbage out, Joe, right? Flawed input leads to flawed output. But the more dangerous form of this hubris is garbage in, gospel out. Where even flawed data from an
AI system is just blindly accepted as absolute truth. Yeah. Right. Similarly, we have to be careful about forecasting error. or just assuming past trends will continue linearly. That rarely happens in today's dynamic AI accelerated world, this garbage in gospel out thing. It isn't just technical. It's a profound reminder that in our increasingly datadriven world, human discernment, skepticism,
critical thinking, they're not just soft skills anymore. They are essential filters for truth. That's a really important point. So, what does all this mean for your future skill development? and how can education actually prepare you to thrive in this rapidly changing landscape. Okay, beyond the exciting applications and these shifts in the job market, we absolutely need to talk about the critical
challenges and ethical considerations. They definitely accompany AI's integration into education. Let's start with bias in AI algorithms. Yeah, bias is a big one. It can stem from either biased training data, the information the AI learns from, or the algorithms design itself. If there's bias in that data, the AI can perpetuate, even amplify existing inequalities, leading to unfair advantages or
disadvantages for certain student groups. It also raises issues of transparency and accountability naturally. So, how do we fight that? Well, mitigation strategies include things like regular audits of the algorithms, ensuring diverse representation in the data sets used for training, and really collaborative efforts involving educators, policy makers, and the developers themselves. Then there are
significant privacy concerns. AI has this uh insatiable appetite for personal data as one source put it which raises issues around how that data is stored, how it's used, who gets access and the risk of unauthorized dissemination or even identity theft. It's absolutely crucial to have transparent communication about why data is being collected and importantly to get user consent. Organizations
like the partnership on AI, it's a coalition of leading companies. They're actively working to address these concerns. Establishing ethical benchmarks. Okay. On a more positive note though, AI can also potentially help bridge the digital divide. That's the hope. For underserved communities, AIdriven mobile apps could provide educational resources where traditional schooling is maybe limited or
inaccessible. Improving digital accessibility. Exactly. And ensuring fair access requires a multiaceted approach. It includes providing the necessary hardware and internet connectivity, what we call digital inclusion. The basics. The basics. Yeah. Ensuring everyone has the fundamental tools to participate. It also involves integrating AI educational tools into curricula thoughtfully, training
educators on how to use these tools effectively, and ensuring equitable distribution of AI tools and resources among different schools and communities. It can't just be for the wealthy districts. Absolutely. This raises a really important question. What do the actual people involved, the educators, the students, the parents, what do they think about this rapid shift? Are they embracing it or is
there push back? Well, perspectives from educators are, as you might expect, mixed, but seem largely positive about the potential. Some really embrace AI tools. Things like Grammarly for writing help, Magic Eraser for images, Tetra for taking notes. They find these tools improve efficiency in lesson planning, test scoring, freeing up more time for actual student interaction. Yeah, I could see
that. However, concerns definitely exist. That garbage in, garbage out principle we talked about. What if the AI source material is low quality or the risk of overrusting AI systems just taking their output as fact? And some educators also worry about students using AI programs like chat GPT to complete assignments. You know, potentially leading to a lack of personal touch, a lack of originality
in student work. And what about the students themselves? From the student perspective, it seems those with a higher understanding of AI tend to have more positive views on its integration in the classroom. Makes sense. While some do fear it can't match human creativity a valid concern, the majority seem to express satisfaction with benefits like personalized learning, adaptive assessments, getting
that real-time feedback. And parental and community involvement is seen as pretty crucial, too. Our sources show that something like 86% of parents want new ways for their kids to learn critical computing skills. They see family involvement in AI education as a way to create a more holistic learning environment and maybe even bridge generational gaps in understanding this new technology. Okay,
let's look to the horizon then. What emerging technologies could further reshape education? This is where the future implications really start to come into focus. And some of it sounds well almost like science fiction. We're talking about things like brain computer interfaces, BCIs. The idea is they could enable direct thought-based interaction with curriculum. your brain interacting directly with
learning materials. Then there's edge AI processing data closer to the source like on your device for incredibly fast real-time applications. Neuroinformed learning systems drawing insights from neuroscience to optimize educational strategies. Explainable AI XAI designed to make AI decisions transparent so we understand why an AI suggests a certain learning path. and even blockchain technology for
secure credential verification, making your educational achievements instantly verifiable and basically tamperproof. Yeah, some of that sounds futuristic, but maybe not so far off. These emerging technologies, they definitely bring potential disruptions, revolutionizing personalized learning even further, automating more admin tasks, enhancing teaching techniques. However, they also just reiterate
the need for really careful ethical management. The more powerful the tech, the more careful we need to be. And the anticipated challenges for future AI developments are significant. Ongoing ethical concerns, bias, transparency, fairness, potential job redundancy from further automation. A big problem is the lack of standards and regulations keeping pace with how fast AI is developing, increased
privacy and security risks, the danger of overdependency on AI systems, and that everpresent problem of unintended consequences, things we just didn't foresee. Exactly. We also need to consider the energy consumption of these large AI models which is substantial and the challenge of public understanding and perception of AI getting buyin. This really highlights the critical need for establishing
robust regulatory frameworks. We need rules for responsible and ethical AI use and education. For example, the European Commission has articulated a framework for trustworthy AI stating it must be lawful, ethical, and robust. Right. And to achieve responsible implementation on the ground, strategies include establishing ethical review boards within institutions, conducting regular monitoring and
evaluation of AI's actual impact, involving all stakeholders, students, parents, educators, the community, providing continuous training for educators, performing regular audits for bias and effectiveness, improving accessibility for everyone, ensuring human oversight, keeping humans in the loop, promoting transparency and explanability, and obtaining genuine informed consent from users. regarding
their data. And crucially, international cooperation feels essential here. We need to establish global standards for AI development and deployment to ensure a harmonized, responsible approach worldwide. Otherwise, it's the wild west. Well, this deep dive has truly shown that AI's impact on education is well, it's undeniable and is profoundly transformative. From individualized learning and making
admin easier to this crucial need for new human- ccentric skills, AI is reshaping pretty much everything. And it's clear that AI is not just another tool, is it? It's a fundamental shift. It impacts all stakeholders and requires really careful navigation to make sure it serves the ultimate goal of quality education for everyone. Which raises an important question. If AI can now personalize
learning to such a granular extent, predicting exactly when a student might start to struggle or wheel spin as one source put it and offering timely targeted interventions right then. How might this fundamentally redefine our understanding of human learning curves and maybe the very nature of educational support itself? It makes you wonder, doesn't it? What does that capability reveal about
traditional teaching methods where maybe students might have just quietly disengaged without anyone noticing in time?

The CEO of the language-learning app Duolingo has made a bold statement, asserting that artificial intelligence is a better teacher than humans. However, he also noted that schools will not become obsolete since parents still require childcare.  This claim has generated significant backlash. But is AI truly better than humans when it comes to teaching?  Secondary school teacher Paul Menta
explains.  #Duolingo #Teachers #Education
