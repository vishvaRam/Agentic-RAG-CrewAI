I've been using the new chat GBT 5 for the last few days. This will starting today become your default ChatGpt from now on, even if you're a free user. So, how is it better? Well, the first thing you'll probably notice is speed. So, this laptop has the previous model GPT 40 loaded up. This has GPT5. How many rings does Saturn have? Go. Oh my god. GPT5 took 3.1 seconds. This took 6.5. How many
distinct iPhones has Apple made? Go. Oh goodness. Okay. 8.3 seconds. 11.2 seconds. How many possible type combinations exist in Pokémon? Not far off. Actually, quite far off. This has massively over complicated it. 5 seconds. 11 seconds. So really, when you're asking light questions like this, GBT5 is between 30 to 50% faster than the old model. But I wouldn't really say that speed was one of the
key issues before. There's actually a much more important change happening this generation. So if you're a really big user of Chad GBT and you're paying the monthly subscription, it's actually been really freaking confusing to use cuz you open up the app and you have options. You can either pick GBT40, 03, 03 Pro, O4 Mini, 04 Mini High, and each one of these models is its own AI that you can talk
to, and each one is slightly better than the others at one thing or another. And there's even more than those when you click here to expand. How on earth is any normal consumer supposed to be able to decide which one to use for which question? I have always wondered if this AI is actually smart enough to be in the top 10% of test takers sitting the most grueling exams on the planet, why can't it
also just know what's the best model for your specific question and make the choice for you? Well, now finally GBT5 can. This model effectively brings together all the different capabilities of the previously separated specialized models into one general model. Which means if you ask it a question that requires no thinking, then as we've seen, it will use a very light model that's going to be even
faster than the old one. But it also means that if you then ask a heavier question that would benefit from more thinking, it can now do that thinking without you needing to specifically select a mode designed for it. So let's try something very complex. Make me a game of Tetris that I can play in canvas. This is going to mean I can actually play it on the app. So, I'm doing this first on the old
chatbt40. This is the best model that you'd have had access to before without paying. Still though, easily one of the coolest use cases of an AI. We're approaching 200 lines of code here. And okay, that took 57 seconds. And okay, it's very simple. This is like the most basic possible form of Tetris, but I suppose at the same time, I have just entered one sentence and generated a game. So now I
want to try the exact same thing but using 04 mini high. So this in the previous generation is the model that would have been specifically recommended to you for coding and you can only get this by paying the monthly subscription. Go. Oh bling out. This is significantly faster. It's done already. What? That was 14 seconds. And the game is actually almost identical to what GBT40 produced just in
quarter of the time. Okay, let's try it on five. And the thing that I'm curious to see here is a does it decide that this is something that would benefit from more thinking time and take longer? And if it does, does it then make it better? Go. I'd say it's coding slower than 04 mini high, but still faster than 40. Okay, that was actually pretty fast, too. 19 seconds. Interestingly, more lines of
code than both of them. So, it seems like it is making a more complex game. That is like worlds apart. So, it's the same game, but the pieces now have divides in them. It's giving me a score. It's giving me a level. It's showing me the upcoming piece. There's controls at the bottom. Like, okay, don't get me wrong. None of this is something that you couldn't have achieved using previous Chat GBT
models, but it's just the fact that it had the intuition to bake it all in completely unprompted. That's quite impressive. Yeah, it's a vastly better game of Tetris. While we're here though, let's just do something crazy. So, using 04 mini high, make me a playable game of chess where the pieces are all Pokémon with sprites from the internet and make it look premium so that the sprites fill up the
squares. Go. Uh, an error occurred while trying to run your game. It's very cool that you can ask it to fix its own bugs, but in my experience, there's a fairly low success rate. And enter. Loading this time. Error again. Come on. Third time lucky. Ah, yes. Finally. It doesn't look terrible. I mean, it has gone out and picked up Pokémon images from like the very first games in the '90s. And also,
it doesn't work. It's giving me an error message every single time I touch a piece. Same thing in GBT5. Go. Oh, I rate that. Do you see it specifically said thinking longer for a better answer and thinking longer? It absolutely is. This has taken like three times longer than 04. It's actually a little bit crazy just to what extent it's going based on my simple command. Like you can see it coding
in like themes and ways to evolve these Pokémon and like seemingly an entirely new rule set that themes chess itself to Pokémon. I'm actually so curious what is cooked up here. Oh wow. Oh my god. That is a world apart. It's the exact same thing at the Tetris. It's like an implicit understanding of what makes the game look more premium. So, if I click a piece, okay, it not only works, but it also
highlights all of the legally available moves that you can make with that piece. Tells you whose turn it is at the top here. It is actually just leagues ahead of last gen. Right now, at least, GBT5 is feeling a lot less like a sidekick. That's useful, but only useful in so much as you have the coding knowledge yourself to be able to fix it. But okay, coding is still obviously a bit of a niche use.
The thing that I would say is most useful to the most people for AI is just making sure that it's right. Hallucination has been a very real issue with AI. This ability of these chat bots to tell you with full confidence and a straight face something that is actually completely incorrect. And let's be honest, that's not an issue that's suddenly going to be fixed in one generational jump. But they
are saying it's better thanks to a combination of more powerful hardware running this AI, integration of user feedback from the older models as well as just better ways to benchmark AI and therefore better ways to identify places in which it's lacking. So put all these things together, it should mean Chad GBT5 doesn't get things wrong as much. Let me try one that I know Chad GBT used to struggle
with cuz I was asking it this 2 days ago. Give me 10 tech products made by food brands that I can actually buy. So, this is Tphorro. What? McDonald's XT mobile phone? I'm very skeptical. This is not a thing. McDonald's did not make a phone with T-Mobile. And then it's got the KFC gaming console, which you definitely can't buy. You see what I mean, right, though? It just invents stuff with complete
confidence. The C5 is any better. I'm a little skeptical. Coca-Cola mini fridge. Okay, Oreo made smart speakers. Did they though? No. To be honest, GPT5 is not doing any better of a job than four was. It is still inventing stuff. So, this still does need work. Here's another one I know that used to really trip up the older AI. What AI are you? It just gives me gobbledegook. What about here? What
AI is this? I mean, a much more humanoriented answer. This is Chad GBT with the GBT5 model. I specifically asked the question in a slightly obtuse way to see if it could still figure out my intentions and this did right. For me, GBT has been pretty good, but also pretty inconsistent when it comes to creative tasks. So, I want to give both of these something that is extremely challenging to pull
off. Make me a YouTube thumbnail for a Mr. Who's the Boss video titled I Tested Every Star Wars Gadget Ever. Off you go. And it's pretty clear why this is such a challenge. It's got to do my face. It's got to understand the YouTube thumbnail image size. It's got to decide what out of all these potential Star Wars gadgets is the most clickable to an average user. Right. So 40 first. Second one's
not bad. It actually has me holding like a Star Wars blaster and a lightsaber. That's pretty good. I'm just quite cursed. And I don't think those are products you can buy. They're just objects from the universe. What have you done? I would actually say that's worse. It's a little bit less good composition. The text isn't as Star Warsy and it's a square. YouTube thumbnails have to be 16 by 9. What
if you were planning a 30th birthday party and you want it to be Star Wars themed? How well can these make the invitations addressed to Rick? 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Star Wars formal attire and go. Well, this is taking a real long time. That's actually so good. It's Vader in a suit. It's just the right level of sophisticated for a 30-year-old who happens to still be doing a Star Wars party. Maybe
you could have cut one of these Star Wars logos, but apart from that, GPT5's is actually really bland. It just looks like so much less effort has been put into that than 40. So, it's hard to make a sweeping conclusion based on just a few tests. But one thing's pretty clear. GT5 is not a step up when it comes to image generation. But one thing that OpenAI is saying GBT5 should have for sure is
better writing flare, which is actually one of the things I've noticed lacking in the older models. They've always felt a little bit wooden, kind of like they're focusing on getting you an answer as opposed to actually thinking about the delivery of the answer. So, how about we do the old how soon will I be jobless test? Write me a 302 Mr. Who's the Boss Tech fail about the Windows phone. 3 2 1
go. Okay, these are actually quite different looking answers. Okay, let's do the 40 one. And you got to tell me how close this gets to feeling like I've made it. You ever hear the phrase great idea, wrong decade? That was the Windows phone. In 2010, Microsoft launched a slick, fast, super stable phone OS that nobody wanted. Why? No Instagram, no Snapchat, no YouTube app. Even the calculator felt
like a cry for help. They tried paying developers to make apps. Didn't work. They bought Nokia for 7.2 2 billion to boost hardware sales. Still didn't work. Then they deleted Nokia. By 2017, Windows Phone had just 0.1% market share. Microsoft's official advice switched to Android or iPhone. To me, that feels about what you'd expect. I feel like it's not quite done the best job of picking the parts
of that story that were the most important to tell. Also, the calculator on Windows Phone was actually pretty great. So, not at all a reason it failed. The cool thing about this GBT 5 answer is it not just has the script, but it also has notes for how to film it and what B-roll shots we should be using to show each line. So, this is the Windows Phone, Microsoft's big attempt to take on iOS and
Android. It looked different, it felt different, and it failed spectacularly. Turns out having no apps in 2012 was like opening a restaurant without food. Developers didn't bother, customers didn't care, and Microsoft just gave up. By 2017, the dream was dead. And now the only thing it's good for is being a retro paperwe. Rest in peace, Windows phone. You've tiled too close to the sun. It's good.
I'd say still needs work, but that's actually a much better starting point. And it's using analogies in a way that actually makes you think, huh, great point. So ultimately, GT5 is not better at every single thing, but it's still one of those tech launches that's pretty hard to complain about. Like it's clearly a lot better in a lot of ways. They've integrated all the complexity into one simple
model. So they're going to start to phase out the whole this model for coding and this model for reasoning. The monthly subscription is staying the same price. And also you still get access to GPT5 even if you're not paying. There are a couple of asterisks. If you're not a paying user, then it is capped. You'll get say 8 to 10 requests per day using the most powerful GBT. And it's looking like
when you go beyond that limit, you will then use a less powerful but still more powerful than last generation GPT5 Mini.

GPD5 has been out for a week and people are already doing some incredible stuff with it. Hi everyone, I'm Isan Sharma and let me show you 10 amazing use cases of GPD5 that you need to try out today with Chad GPT. Fundamentally, what makes GPT5 better than the previous Chad GPT models is that it can now switch between regular and thinking models automatically. Plus, it is just a much better agentic
model compared to the previous ones. It also rides more like a human. So, let me show you all the crazy stuff that you can do with it today. The first one is all about the agent mode. Because of the long context window that GPT5 gives you, you can now ask it to do a thorough research, use the internet, create a browser, search for as many sources as possible, and give you the most accurate data in
the shortest amount of time possible. All thanks to the chat GPT agent mode powered by GPD5. The first use case is asking it for financial analysis. For example, I wanted to invest in a private company. So, I gave it all the information about the financials of the company and I asked it to do a deep financial research. Look at the market and its growth potential. Look at the financials of this
current company. Look at the fundamentals. Look at the competitors. Look at the recent news in this market and then tell me if it makes sense for me to invest in this company. Here's some information about me as an investor. You will not believe. It took over 30 minutes to go through all the data possible, go through multiple websites, go through all the financial reports I shared with it and gave
me a in-depth analysis of this particular company and if I should invest on it or not. It was really in-depth. I'm amazed by how much it can do. It can search and then give me the final output. Now, after using GPD5, one thing is very clear. AI is advancing at the speed of light and people who understand AI are the ones who are getting promoted and landing highpaying jobs and I just found an
amazing list of AI programs on IoT program advisor marketplace that can help you learn these in- demand AI skills and advance in your career for example advanced AI certification machine learning for professionals and genai application development. These courses cover everything from Python to prompt engineering to lang chain and much more. And the best part everything is hands-on. You'll be
working with the top AI tools and platforms like Gemini, Hugging Face, and TensorFlow, and much more. These courses are live and interactive, not pre-recorded videos. You get direct access to mentors, live doubts sessions, and a community of professionals learning together on Slack. So, if you want to crack your next high-paying job, these are the actual skills companies are looking for today.
Check out the link in the description to know more about these programs. And now, let's get back to the applications of GPD5. The second use case is using agent mode for finding opportunities and jobs. So if you are on LinkedIn, the biggest problem you face is you're just applying for jobs right, left and center, but you're getting calls from no one. Well, you can now use agent mode in chat GPT.
Give it your login information of LinkedIn. Let it log on your LinkedIn profile and it will search opportunities for you. Just basically enter your skill set, tell it the type of company that you want to work with and give it the browser. It will go, it will find multiple profiles, companies who are looking to hire people. It will take about 30 to 40 minutes and then it will come up with the top
five opportunities where you can apply and potentially get a job. The way we use it in my marketing company is to hire people. So I gave it a job description that this is the type of people we're looking for. We want them to urgently join in our Bangalore office. So look for people who are in Bangalore only. And it went through so many profiles, looked at all of their experiences, if their
experience matches with what we are looking for and gave me a list of 10 people who are great potential hires. Then I reached out to them. I even asked Chad GP to send a personalized message to each and every person and it did that automatically. So you can now automate networking. You can now automate opportunity finding all thanks to GPT5 and its ability to think longer than the previous models
to improve on itself faster than the previous models. That's the second use case. The third use case is even more interesting. So imagine you are creating content, you want to make better content, you know the type of creators you want to make content around. So you can literally just go to agent mode of charge GPT and just say that hey I am inspired by the following five creators on YouTube. I
want you to look at their YouTube channels find out the type of content that is working for them really well. Now look at my own channel see the content that works well for me and by looking at all of this information create a list of 10 videos that I can create today which will go viral for my channel. I'm inspired by these previous channels and give me all the information. It literally goes
through every YouTube channel, sorts it by most popular, looks at all the content which is working for this other creator and gives me all the insights I need. It's amazing for content research and it automates the task for you. So you don't have to do it yourself. You can literally just give it the browser, it will do it all for you, and you can just watch it happen in real time. Now the fourth
use case is even more interesting. You can create a screenshot of your website if you run a business or a screenshot of your LinkedIn profile and give it to it and ask it to optimize your landing page, optimize your LinkedIn profile for the particular opportunities that you're looking for, for the type of conversion rate that you're looking for on your website. It will go look at your website, how
is it performing? It will suggest improvements not just on the text, the copyrightiting, but also on the layout, the usability, responsiveness. It will look at all of that and give you a thorough research of it and it is doing it much better than the previous models were doing. The fifth use case of chat GPT5 is helping you create better content. So you can finally have a custom GPT in which you
can enter all of your previous LinkedIn posts. You can ask it to now create a new LinkedIn post based on a news that is out there and it will do it really well. Why? Because it finally hallucinates less. It is finally able to write content which has more context, which is feeling more human and which can connect with the audience and can write very well in your own style. So, it does it really
well without all the emojis and the immature language used by GPT4 in the past and do it really effectively for content writing. It's great for creating LinkedIn posts, for creating scripts for Instagram reels and a lot more. All you have to master is the prompts that you are using. By the way, I have this amazing tool which I just made myself when I was free called promptmaxer.com. You can
basically go on it and you can ask it to create a in-depth JSON prompt for the thing that you want it to do. So let's say you want it to create a image of a duck flying. So you just enter my basic prompt is to generate an image using chatg image creator and enter the duck flying image. It will then create a in-depth JSON prompt mentioning everything from the reflections, the style, the background,
the emotion and it will give it to you that you can enter into Chad GPT image creator and get a much better looking image. This was the image that you made by just writing a single line of prompt image of a duck flying and this is the image that you created by using a in-depth JSON prompt. You can see the difference. It's all about creating better structured prompts and promptmaxer.com can help
you with it. I just made this free tool. Go try it out if you want to. Now, apart from being great at helping me write better content, it can also plan for anything that I have in the future. So, for example, if I have a 15-day San Francisco trip, I can ask it to plan the entire itinary with the budget and every option that I want it to do. Now, you could do that previously as well, but now you
have the opportunity for it to think longer. So it thinks longer about the problem, looks at all the alternatives and then suggests me everything that I can do along with other options available to me as well. So it gave me the entire list of the places to visit, the place to live in, the food to try out, offices to go to, the people to meet, the events to attend, everything. It did a deep
research on it and gave me the entire information in minutes. It's great for giving you in-depth information if that is what you're looking for. Another thing with GPD5 is great at is coding and particularly helping you create these 2D platformer games in minutes. So, you enable the canvas mode when you're on Jad GPD5 and you start asking it to create any 2D game that you want. For example, I
asked it to make a simple space shooter game and it literally wrote all the code. It took permission from me and then when I clicked on preview, I could actually play the game by myself. It handles all the physics really well of shooting the gun and everything. It also does a very good job of filling in the details. So I just wrote a very simple prompt that I just want a space shooter game and it
made all the details on its own which is really really impressive. What is the use case of it though? If you're thinking like what will I do with making these simple games? Maybe you want to engage your audience. Maybe you run a business in which you're trying to explain a concept which is complicated like investments, complicated topic like insurance, any other topic that you want them to
understand. You can ask GPD5 to make this simple game that they can play and then they can understand the topic really well. Every major app be it you know Flipkart or Amazon or Netflix or Zomato, they're all integrating these games inside of their app that you can play to engage more with the app itself. And you can now do that with GPD5. Another use case of GPT5 is helping you build those
internal tools and dashboards. Now you can now create entire frontends by just writing a single line of prompt to GPD5. For example, in my team I have editors, I have designers, I have a manager and I wanted to make a dashboard to see every video which is going out. So I just asked GPD5 to make me a simple front end where I can manage all the content with the with the deadlines. It should be one
place where I can assign a video to a editor. I can review how well that video has gone and I can do that all on one platform itself. And it made it all for me to review. That is really impressive. You can even create these simple calculator platforms in which you can see for yourself how your business is performing and depending on any lever that you change. Maybe you're changing the CTR of your
video, maybe you're changing the video average view duration, maybe you are changing the number of videos that you're making. You can see how much money will you be making by the end of the month as a creator. So these are small internal tools that you can make for yourself to make life easier and you can do that now by just writing oneline prompt one shot creating those entire front ends all
thanks to GPD5. So it's really great at creating these apps and just amazing at coding. Another use of GPT5 is creating custom GPTs. You could do that before as well but now let's say you want to make a board of directors who can help you live your life better. For example, I run a marketing company. So I can ask GPT5 to look at these authors and founders, the type of books that they've written,
identify the patterns in every single book and the message that they deliver and create a document for each of these authors outlining their philosophy for doing business, for marketing, their learnings, their skill sets, everything. So I now have three to four documents, txt files that I can now download from GPD5 and I can create a custom GPT in which I can upload all of them and I can now
prompt it for anything that I'm facing a problem of. For example, I want to hire more senior talent and for that I can ask it a question that hey I'm trying to hire senior talent. What is the advice that you would give me? And it gives me a custom response based on the context it has about the people and their philosophy of doing business and hiring people and marketing in general. And that is
wonderful. You can finally have contextual advice for you based on the learnings of people who've done it in the past. And you can even now talk to them with the voice feature. So it's like talking to your real mentors without having to meet them in person. Let's say you love the philosophy of Gary Vee, of Alex Heroszi, of any other person that you're inspired by. You can now have a literal advice
GPT which can help you make better decisions and live life better. And now the last use case of GPT5 is actually helping you make AI agents. You can access GPT5 and its API key for NA10 for make.com. So you can basically use the power of GPT5 for any workflow that you have. For example, I made a workflow recently on make.com which helps me turn any uh news article that I have into a LinkedIn post
along with an image and it sends it to me on email. Now that whole workflow will be powered by GPT5 which makes it even stronger. I have another workflow which helps me plan my entire day. It can now do it even better all thanks to GPT5 because it's great at planning and thinking deeply about anything that I have going on in my day. You can also go to NA10 and build a complex AI agent workflow all
powered by GPD5. You can also go to Lindy AI and that creates a workflow for you. Let's say you want to take meetings and need need notes for the meeting. Maybe you want to make personal assistance that can help you run your whole life, maybe help you pick stocks. GPT5 will now be powering all of these automations and workflows for your life. Which means that every output you get is going to be
more polished. It's going to feel more human. It's going to be well researched and at the end it's going to help you become a better person, save more money and time at the end of the day. So those were the top 10 use cases of Chad GPT5. Let me know below in the comment section what do you think is the craziest one that you've heard in this entire video. That's all from me today. Let me know if
you have any questions below in the comments. Also check out the AI programs on IoT programs advisor marketplace if you want to start learning and upskilling in the world of AI. I'll see you in the next video. Hit the like button and subscribe. Bye-bye.

Uberai just unveiled Chad GPT5 and it is honestly insane. Hi everyone, I'm Ishan Sharma. I've been trying out GPT5 for the past couple of days and let me show you everything about it. I'll first tell what the model is about, how is it better than the previous charge GPT models or other models in general and I'll also give you some examples of what all you can do with it. Make sure you watch till
the end, hit the like button and subscribe. And this is the very first preview of GPT5 for all of you. First of all, what is GPD5? So, GPD5 is Charge GPT's latest, fastest, and the smartest model. First things first, GPD5 will be available to everyone. Even if you are using Charge GPT for completely free, which means for the very first time, you have a thinking model available to you for
completely free of cost without paying anything. Secondly, it is now possible for you to use just one single model. GBT5 will automatically change between thinking and reasoning modes and regular mode on its own. You do not need to switch between 03 or just use 40. It will do it automatically. Which means this model can understand the problem that you've given it and then figure out the best way
to solve it. If you give it a very complex problem, it will activate its thinking reasoning model. It was never possible before. You had to specifically pick the O3 model. You have to memorize which model is best for what. But now all of that is gone. You just have one singular model, Chat GPT5, that can do it all for you. As Sam Ortman has always been saying, this gets us one step closer to AGI,
a model which can do pretty much everything. Enough of me talking. Let me actually show you how Chad GPD5 works. So when you open Chad GPT once you have access to it, it will automatically just switch to Chad GPD5. If you click on this, you can see that GPD5 is the flagship model. Other models which are available here will soon be gone. many of these and you can simply start by typing out any
query that you have. Let's suppose give it a task to write us a letter. So I'll just say write a 400word letter in the style of Shah Ruk Khan. So let's see how it does it. It's actually really fast. As you can see it's much faster than 40. And the writing feels more human as you can see. If you will read it, it will actually feel like something that a normal person has written, not something that
a GPT or a LM has generated. Something more useful. Let's ask it to write a LinkedIn post and it will write it really quickly as you can see. So the writing is significantly improved as you see everything is written with keeping the human element in mind. Now let's do a more difficult problem. So I will ask it to do a SWAT analysis for a business idea that I have. So I'll just paste and enter. It
will think about it. As you can see it automatically knows that this is a question which will require it to think. So it automatically change into the thinking mode. As you can see, thought for 4 seconds and you can see the thinking mode of it. Searches the web for important documents and information and gives you the exact SWAT analysis for the question that you've asked. You can take the same
question and give it to O3 and it will take much longer for it to respond and the response might not be as in-depth as well. As you can see, it's really long, covers everything and you get a whole idea about the question that you've asked the SWAT analysis along with that the target customer profile, commutative landscape, monetization plan and so on and so forth. Now, it's going to be even better
for agent capabilities. So, if you're using charge GPT agent for any of the tasks, GPD5 is going to do it much much better. GPD5 is also amazing for coding. So if I enter a simple prompt to give me some Python code, it's going to immediately start writing after thinking about it and it's going to improve the code quality as much as it can versus previous models that you might have tried. So this
is the code. It gives proper comments over here and then writes the entire code out for you like so. So this is the state-ofthe-art best model on even SU benchmarks. So it's going to be the best model for coding that you have used. I know some people might have been using claude for all the coding tasks but apparently this is now the fastest model for coding and with the highest quality code as
well. So I'll have to test it out more but you can see the length at which it goes to give me the exact code for implementing the task which I wanted to work on. And it even gives me more recommendations if I want to look into that. I even asked it to make a snake game for my sister, but she likes Taylor Swift a lot. So, it basically opened a canvas. It wrote out all the code and now I can even
just do a simple preview to see what Chad GPT5 created. So, this is the code itself. I can try playing this and this is my snake game right over here. So, I need to collect the hearts and as soon as I do that, I will win or I will lose. So, that's basically the game that it made. Super cool, very easy for you to just make simple MVPs for any app that you want to create and just show it to people
if you want to build it further. So that is how Chai GPD5 works. It's amazing how it can switch between normal models and thinking and reasoning models according to the task that you've given to it. I asked it to give me all the information for organizing a AI hackathon. It thought for 23 seconds. As you can see, this is the chain of thought thinking and I can see the exact summary, venue layout,
the volunteer roles, sponsor packages, benefits, everything written out to me with an in-depth answer right here. And I can always give feedback on it if I like it. You can even ask it to make a business automation for you. So, for example, if I just enter this make me a make.com automation for invoice processing and it's going to think about it and give me the exact step-by-step process for
making this automation for my business. So all the modules I need the code I need to write the Google sheets router flow slack send message example HTTP request everything mentioned right over here. I can even ask it to solve a mathematical problem. So I can say think about this and press enter and it will be using the thinking model for solving this maths problem. Now this is a problem from
international mathematics olympiad which very few models can solve but finally we have GPD5 which can solve it step by step and even explain what it did and why it did it. And this is the final answer. So that's essentially how chad GPT5 works. It is the best model out there that you can try. It is the fastest, the smartest. It can change between different modes depending on your question.
available for completely free for free Chad GPT users and it is out today. You tell me in the comment section what will you build with Chad GPT5. What do you think it is the best suited for? If you want to use it for writing, you now know that it writes even better and feels more human. So try it out yourself. Let me know below in the comment section what do you think of it. I will see you all in
the next video. Bye-bye.

So, by now everyone largely knows what GPT5 is and how the model works. But in today's video, I want to actually discuss the future iterations of the model such as GPT6 and any future update that's coming to GPT5 based on various different interviews I've seen online. So, let's get into it. So, one of the things I actually want to talk about is the model router. So, most people have actually had a
pretty terrible experience with GPT5 due to the model router routing to the wrong model most of the time. And I think it's because of the fact that OpenAI are really the only company that I've seen use a model router. I understand that they wanted to have an AI that essentially seems smarter. You know, you ask it a question and sometimes it thinks for a while and then you ask it another question
and it just reasons quickly. But whatever they're doing with a model router, it honestly has backfired in a way that I couldn't have foreseen because it on surface looks like GPT5 overall is a bit dumber. But if you look deeper into the technicals and you know the benchmarks, you realize that isn't the case. But you know, even here, what you're seeing on screen right now, you can see that they
said it should seem smarter starting today because the auto switcher was out of commission. But even after to, you know, turning the auto switcher back on after the update, it still doesn't feel that good. There's just something about GBT5 that just feels like it is missing. Now, of course, in future, they do talk about the updates to the model switcher. And then, so here we have Greg Brockman on
a podcast discussing the fact that, you know, the model switcher is essentially here for now, but it isn't going to be here for the future. And they're going to be working on some different architectures. By the way, I do want to say model switchers are not necessarily the future, right? They are the present. Like having a fully integrated model that just does the right thing feels very preferable
in many ways. The flip side though is that I think that the evidence has been away from having the final form factor, the AGI itself being a single model, but instead thinking about this menagery of models that have different strengths and weaknesses. And I think that's like a very interesting finding of the past couple years, right? Just a direction of like it's much easier to have small fast
model that's less capable but can do a lot more. You can generate a lot more tokens from it coupled with a much more expensive reasoning model. And if you combine those two things, you kind of get adaptive compute. And that we haven't really cracked how do you do adaptive compute within the architecture, but doing it within the orchestration of a system, it's very straightforward. And so I think
you get a lot of power out of the fact that these models are composable in this way. So overall, I think that the model switcher, it might not be the best thing. Maybe there's going to be some new architectures in the future or maybe they'll just get, you know, an auto router that is a little bit better, but I would love to see an improvement on that because in theory it does make sense to have a
model router, something that can think, but right now, however they're doing it, it just doesn't seem to be working. Now, another feature that I think, you know, is probably not going to be there in the future. And Sam Alman basically confirmed this on Reddit was that he said that they haven't seen a ton of demand for really long context. They say that they're still open to supporting it with
sufficient user demand signals and they have to make a lot of trade-offs about what they support and they're on a tight compute budget. So, they're going to prioritize what will be useful to the most people. So, they're, you know, asking people what kind of context lens they want. But the truth is is that I've realized now that with OpenAI, they are essentially appealing to the mass market, which
means that they're appealing to the broadest customers possible. Which is why in some cases the, you know, power users of AI, you know, like most people watching this video, if you want to use a really specific model, you'll know which one to pick. You'll know the difference between 034 and GPT4, GPT 4.5, like you'll know the difference. But since they're appealing to the mass mass market, they've
realized that, you know, they the mass mass market just uses the chat interface in a standard way and they really don't, you know, have a really huge need for super long context windows. I know Google and Enthropic do have them, but they're kind of like not specialist AI tools, but most people who use chat GPT don't really know about other AI models anyways. So, it's going to be super interesting
to see how that is in the future. I mean, this is kind of surprising, but you know, looking forward with OpenAI's goal, it now actually does make sense with regards to how they're positioning the company and how they're trying to gain market share. I mean, if we do look at the available context window, we can see in free it's 8,000 tokens. In Plus, it's only 32,000 tokens and the pro version it's
128,000 tokens. So, it's going to be super interesting to see. But I'm guessing that once again they're doing this because they're on a, you know, a pretty tight budget. And of course, they do want the company to make money as most people don't realize that OpenAI is a company that does burn through millions and millions of dollars and they're going through a pretty rough patch right now. So, it's
going to be interesting to see how that, you know, kind of changes in the future cuz I did see a few tweets on Twitter where people were simply not happy with this. Now, there's another thing that is pretty crazy. probably the first time in AI that this has really happened, but it's the fact that they're actually working on an update to GPT5's personality, which apparently was something that many
users really did demand. So, if you aren't familiar with this, essentially, and I think it's pretty crazy that one of the key things that people actually liked about GPT40 was the personality. I mean, when we take a look at this, we can actually see here that there are tweets and there were Reddit posts about how, you know, losing GPT4 felt like losing a friend and how it was one of the most human
AIs. And I said this a while back once the Psychop Fantasy update was released. I said it it's really true. Like, when we look at AI, we have to realize that the cat is now out of the bag. Like, people have already started to use these like their friends. They've already, you know, put, you know, certain characteristics on them. They've already anthorized these models. And it's a situation now
where if OpenAI does roll it back, it's too late because they've already become attached to these platforms and the kind of personalities that they have. So, when you remove them, people are going to immediately say, "Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring it back." And, you know, if OpenAI didn't bring it back, they would simply use a different provider who has a similar personality. And I think
that's why I said, you know, the cat is out of the bag. Now, they did that update where, you know, the models were a little bit too agreeable and now they're struggling to have a model that is somewhat logical, but also somewhat has that human like touch. But I think that is kind of where I think we we should also expect like a lot of progress on the on the actual kind of you know um interfaces
that we interact with. Mhm. you know, we see like ch can can feel quite humanlike. We can form attachments with it. I think you know, as it becomes more persistent, as it becomes kind of capable of expressing itself in like different forms and text, right? like I think that those effects will become stronger and again like that will be something uh I think will become a a very big and important
conversation and it's now literally a part of the future models because they're saying that you know they're going to make sure that GP5 is warmer and friendlier and that's based on the feedback that it felt too formal before the changes are going to be subtle but chat GPT should feel more approachable now it says you'll notice small genuine touches like good question or great start and not
complete flattery. So, this is something that I think is, you know, fascinating because it's the first time where humans have kind of demanded that an AI retain certain parts of its personality and it just goes to show what happens when you roll something out to the mass market and there are some unintended consequences. Now, you know, on the OpenAI podcast, they also talk about how that
personality is going to change. And if we're actually going to look at some of the future abilities for GPT5, one of the things that most people didn't really talk about was the fact that GPT5 is essentially designed to perform very well on long-term tasks. So I think most people expected GPT5 to do well across a broad variety of different benchmarks and it certainly does but one of the areas that
GBT5 currently excels at is long you know horizon tasks. That just basically means it can work for longer more successfully and I think that in future is going to become one of the most important benchmarks considering the fact that most AI systems are supposed to be moving towards full autonomy. And I think if we realize that AI systems are moving towards full autonomy, people might start to
realize that those are the benchmarks that will matter because that's how it's going to be used in the economy, especially in you know, enterprise situations, which is what OpenAI really does want. I mean, they're, you know, really dominating the API right now in terms of, you know, business use cases. Whilst, you know, most people realize that, yes, some people can use other models, when it comes
to like API usage, OpenAI is just by far the easiest to set up and use. So I mean what you're looking at here is the time horizon of software engineering tasks different LMS can complete and we can see that GBT5 is at the top of that and it's going to be super super interesting to see how that moves forward and they do talk about this as well in the interview where they say that you know moving
forward that's going to be an area of focus for them. Now in the interview we also do see Greg Brockman talk about future model architectures. Here they discussed, you know, having the new GPT open-source model on device and potentially having that as sort of like a model selector where it calls models from the cloud. I mean, it's super super interesting and I think it, you know, kind of shows us
how they're exploring multiple different ways to, you know, have these models in our daily lives like like you always say. Yeah. I think it's also really interesting to think about an architecture where you have a local model that then delegates to a remote model sometimes, right? And this can be something where it can run much faster. It's helpful for a privacy architecture perspective um that
just trying to decide what actually goes, what stays and having that edge compute means that then you lose internet connection, you're still able to do something and you can have a slower planning model. It's like this interplay between those things is very interesting. Yeah. So like a GPT5 on device where you have GTOSS here and then it routes through online if it's available. I don't know. Yeah,
something like that. And then you have your codeex infrastructure that has a local agent and a remote agent and then is able to seamlessly, you know, interplay between the two um and then is able to do multiplayer. Like this is what the future is going to look like and it's going to be amazing. And so here we have another statement that most people sort of I don't want to say dismissed as sort of
like a hypo statement but it was super interesting because Samman here does talk about the fact that like you know GPT6 is going to be a real thing but they talk about what if GPT6 can discover new science. Now, before you do say that, whoa, whoa, whoa, GBT6 is, you know, never going to discover new science. It can barely respond now, we have to remember that there are three iterations of GPT5 and
the version of GPT5 high, the highest reasoning version is actually up there. Like, I know it doesn't feel like it right now because of how the model switcher is and your general perception is that the model's not that good, but based on what I've seen and based on the different AIs out there, it's super interesting to see how they're starting to embed these AIs into different architectures. I
mean, possibly you'll be asking me like, "What does it mean that this thing can go discover new science?" Yeah. What how how is the world supposed to think about GBT6 discovering new science? Now, maybe not like maybe we don't deliver that, but it feels within grasp if you did, what would you say? What would your what would the implications of that kind of achievement be? Imagine you do succeed.
Yeah. I mean, I think the great parts will be great, the bad parts will be scary, and the bizarre parts will be like bizarre on the first day, and then we'll get used to them really fast. One of the things that most people don't realize is there was something called Alpha Evolve. And essentially, they kind of used LLM to discover new math, which was pretty crazy. Of course, they didn't just ask an
LLM, hey, discover new math. It was like an entire system, but the fact that an LLM was used in the architecture was pretty pretty crazy. So, it was something that was quite surprising. And the reason I'm showing you guys this is because most people are going to say there's no way GPT6 discovers anything new. But Sam Alman does say, you know, it's possible that they don't discover that because of
course, you know, GPT6 is probably going to be like a consumer product. They are a product, you know, company. But if they do have a model internally that they use to discover things like new science, it is potentially possible. Like it isn't completely out of there. So let me know what you guys think about this. if you guys still enjoying GBT5, the futures of GBT 5 and GB6, where you'd want them
to see them take the model.
